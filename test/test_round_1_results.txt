BAMAZON - RESULTS FROM TEST, ROUND 1 

d = deferred
e = met by enhancement
f = failed
p = passed
s = skipped
w = waiting for further work

Requirements
============
[p] Uses npm mysql package (literally)
[p] Uses npm inquirer package
[p] CLI application
[p] Contains MySQL db 'bamazon' with a table called 'products' containing:
   (p) item_id (unique id for each product)
   (p) product_name (Name of product)
   (p) department_name
   (p) price (cost to customer)
   (p) stock_quantity (how much of the product is available in stores)
[p] DB is populated with 10+ products
[p] Contains Node application 'bamazonCustomer.js`.
[p] On startup, application displays all available items, with ids, names, and price
[p] App has two prompts after startup display completes
   (p) input id of product to purchase
   (p) quantity desired
[p] App checks if quantity available >= quantity desired and responds
   (p) fulfills order if enough is available, updates quantity remaining, and shows total price
   (p) rejects order if enough is not available

Bonus
=====
BONUS 1
[W] Adds Node application called `bamazonManager.js`.
[w] On startup, application list a set of menu options:
   () View Products for Sale
   () View Low Inventory
   () Add to Inventory
   () Add New Product
[w] `View Products for Sale` lists every available item: the item IDs, names, prices, and quantities.
[w] `View Low Inventory` lists all items with an inventory count lower than five.
[w] `Add to Inventory` displays a prompt that will let the manager "add more" of any item
[w] `Add New Product` enables addition of a completely new product
BONUS 2
[w] Adds new MySQL table `departments` containing the following columns:
   () department_id
   () department_name
   () over_head_costs (A dummy number set for each department)
[w] Modifies the products table so that there's a product_sales column
[w] Modifies `bamazonCustomer.js` to update each individual product's total revenue from each sale.
[w] Adds Node app `bamazonSupervisor.js`.
[w] On start-up, application lists:
   () View Product Sales by Department
   () Create New Department
[w] `View Product Sales by Department` displays a table in bash similar to this:

| department_id | department_name | over_head_costs | product_sales | total_profit |
| ------------- | --------------- | --------------- | ------------- | ------------ |
| 01            | Electronics     | 10000           | 20000         | 10000        |
| 02            | Clothing        | 60000           | 100000        | 40000        |

[w] `total_profit` is computed on the fly using the difference between `over_head_costs` and `product_sales`
[w] add `total_profit` column to the `departments` table.
BONUS 3
[w] Remove `total_profit` column and use a custom alias. (See hints in assignment.)

Functionality
=============
[p] Game initializes globals correctly
[p] Game reinitializes globals correctly
[p] DB initializes via seed file without error 
[p] App computes correct total price
[p] App correctly updates DB with quantity available after a sale
[f] App rejects product id if it does not exist in DB
  (f) id = 0
  (p) id > 10
  (p) id is string
  (p) id is empty string

Display
=======
None

Installation
============
[d] Package installs correctly in a new directory
[d] All dependencies are in package.json

Cleanup
=======
[d] JS delinted
