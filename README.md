# Bamazon!

## What the project does
This is an implementation of the Bamazon project, done as homework for the February 2018 UNC Coding Boot Camp. When complete, it will be a database-backed storefront application with a command line interface. Further comments on the app and code will be added here when it is complete.

## How to get started with the application
You will be able to download the application from GitHub Pages eventually, but it's not yet ready.

Once it is:

You must have MySQL installed on your computer. Once you have it ready, download the application from GitHub. In a terminal window, enter ('$' is the prompt):

	$ mysql -u <user name> -p < bamazonSeed.sql
	
and then enter your password. If your user account does not require a password (bad security for the real world, but OK for homework), omit the '-p'. This will create an instance of the bamazon database and populate it with some product data.

## Authors
This application is being built and will be maintained by Mark Hainline. Help should not be needed, and will not be available.
