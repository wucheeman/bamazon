# Bamazon!

## What the project does
This is an implementation of the Bamazon project, done as homework for the February 2018 UNC Coding Boot Camp. When complete, it will be a database-backed storefront application with a command line interface. Further comments on the app and code will be added here when it is complete.

## How to get started with the game
You will be able to download the application from GitHub Pages eventually, but it's not yet ready.

## Authors
This application is being built and will be maintained by Mark Hainline. Help should not be needed, and will not be available.
